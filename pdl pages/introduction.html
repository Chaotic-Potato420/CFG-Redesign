                        <h2>The Story So Far</h2>
                        <p>
                            The computer industry has never been noted for its tentative approach to new product development. New ideas, hailed 
                            at one moment as technological breakthroughs, seem to become obsolete even as they're removed from their cartons.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In contrast PDL is an idea from the 1970's which today, more than twenty years later, remains the de facto standard 
                            for procedure-intensive software design. Other tools have come and gone, leaving PDL more popular and more widely used 
                            than ever throughout the world.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ideas behind PDL were formulated by <a href="../index.html">Caine, Farber & Gordon, Inc.</a> (CFG) 
                            in 1973. They were presented at the National Computing Conference in 1975 where CFG first made 
                            public the significant productivity gains achieved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From this beginning, PDL has been adopted world-wide. It is used across a broad spectrum of applications 
                            for projects of all sizes. In almost every case, it was chosen on the strength of the most genuine 
                            advertising of all: word-of-mouth.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Today, the original PDL/74 has been superseded by PDL/81 which offers considerable power and 
                            flexibility. Yet the ideas behind PDL, and the original language, itself, have not changed at all.

                        <h2>Summarizing the Benefits</h2>
                        <p>
                            One way of illustrating the benefits of PDL is to consider the comments of users. They give a 
                            variety of benefits as being the most important â€” reflecting the many ways in which PDL can be 
                            used and the variety of methodologies it complements. The six benefits mentioned most frequently 
                            are listed below. All lead to the goal of greater productivity.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Less Risk</h3>
                        <p>The management risk in software development is substantially reduced since designs can be tested against requirements at an early stage.</p>
                        <h3>Reliabilty</h3>
                        <p>Programs are better organized and more reliable since they start with a complete, thoroughly considered design.</p>
                        <h3>Visibility</h3>
                        <p>Software visibility is higher so estimates of progress can be more accurately obtained.</p>
                        <h3>Communication</h3>
                        <p>Misunderstandings are avoided since everyone involved in a project uses a common, unambiguous medium for communication. This has proven especially so on projects involving multiple contractors and on multinational projects.</p>
                        <h3>Documentation</h3>
                        <p>Documentation in the form of PDL/81 Design Documents is available on-line before coding starts.</p>
                        <h3>Flexibility</h3>
                        <p>Multiple designs can be economically produced and compared in cases where the requirements are not given in full or where it is necessary to maximize the capabilities of a system within a given budget.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="principlesDiv">
                        <h2>PDL/81 Principles</h2>
                        <p>The development of PDL was guided by three principles. Today these are widely accepted as standard practice in developing reliable and efficient software.</p>
                        <h3>Design first, code second</h3>
                        <p>
                            The design process is the creative, and most crucial part of the software developer's role.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is a three-stage process. First, you must understand and absorb the problem the software needs to 
                            address. Second, create the ideas which solve the problem. Third, refine them until you can be highly 
                            confident that you have a complete solution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Along the way, however, the design ideas need to be expressed and documented. In this, the designer 
                            faces similar problems to those of a foreign language translator, needing to make sure the quality of 
                            the original design idea is not lost when expressed in a new language.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A language is needed in which design ideas can be expressed easily but with complete accuracy. And, 
                            it needs to be just as suited to early design sketches as to finished, complex designs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a programming language is used, there is an immediate handicap because its specifics â€” only needed 
                            when communicating with a machine â€” quickly overshadow the design ideas. The result is an ill-conceived 
                            program which, at best, solves only part of the original problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            PDL avoids this predicament by using a design language, not a programming language. It recognizes 
                            that designing is a creative process, while coding is a more mechanical one, and draws a clear 
                            distinction between the two.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Using PDL, a complete, considered, and printed design is produced before any code is written.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Write in a form your customer can read</h3>
                        <p>
                            Software design exists to solve customers' problems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since these problems are often particular to each customer, it follows that they are the best judges of whether a design will actually work. But they can only do so it is is written in a form they can understand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This cuts both ways. If the customer can read the design, the designer's grasp of the problem can be easily assessed, as can the accuracy of the specification of the problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This is why a design written in PDL is presented in a form that is clear and uncomplicated. Even people with no programming experience can understand it. Customers are able, and encouraged, to iron-out problems and make improvements at a stage when it is still economical to do so.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A customer isn't necessarily the party paying the bill. It could be the manager who set the task, or even the software developer with a personal design goal to be achieved. In the broadest sense a customer can be anyone who knows the problem and has an interest in seeing it solved.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            PDL lets anyone read a design. The more people who read it, the more likely it is to fully satisfy all their needs.
                        </p>

                            Up to a point, diagrams can play a useful role in software development. At the higher level of the process, their many shapes and forms can communicate the fundamentals of a design and the broad relationships between the various parts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the volume of detail increases, however, the usefulness of diagrams becomes questionable. They become hard to read, unwieldy to handle and expensive to maintain. They also have the dangerous tendency to highlight all that is good and present in the design, while actually obscuring what's wrong or missing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The answer lies in the most basic, and yet most expansive, information carrier we know: plain English. Our experience and understanding of English is far greater than that of diagrams.

                            With PDL, the designer has two powerful tools: the richness and familiarity of English, and the structure and precision found in a programming language. The result is unambiguous English â€” and total comprehension all around.

                            The PDL language is a combination of English and PDL Keywords. English provides the richness and 
                            the variety the designer is used to using; the keywords add the means to specify structure and avoid 
                            ambiguity.

                                The overall structure of a PDL design is formed by dividing it into Flow Segments. A Flow Segment 
                                corresponds roughly to a procedure in the final implementation. A typical design comprises a 
                                hierarchy of Flow Segments in which a main segment references others, which in turn reference others.

                                The mechanics of writing in PDL are simple. A design is written to a source file using any 
                                text editor. Having entered the the name of a Flow segment, the PDL statements that compose 
                                it are entered in free form. Then the problem of presenting the design in a high-standard, 
                                cross-referenced Design Document is left entirely to the PDL/81 Processor.

                                Example 3 is an extract from the source file showing exactly what was written by the designer.

                        <p>The <em>PDL/81</em> processor completely removes the burden of presenting <em>PDL</em> designs in documents which have a consistent form and high standard.</p>
                        <p>
                            <em>PDL/81</em> can be used at any time during a project to print a
                            fully-legible, cross-referenced design document.
                            The layout encourages fast understanding by the reader, while the
                            deliberately economical use of visual enhancements prevents the impact
                            of a page detracting from its content.  
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It doesn't matter if a design is incomplete: <em>PDL/81</em> will always
                            produce a complete design document in which the unfinished parts will
                            be obvious.
                            Even an early design sketch can be documented with <em>PDL/81</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At its simplest level, <em>PDL/81</em> automatically does such things as:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>printing each flow segment on a separate page;</li>
                            <li>highlighting keywords;</li>
                            <li>indenting statements to correspond to nesting levels;</li>
                            <li>detecting and cross-referencing calls from one flow segment to another; and</li>
                            <li>detecting and cross-referencing the use of data items.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Each of these functions is illustrated in Example 2.</p>
                        <p>
                            Beyond these functions, the power and flexibility of <em>PDL/81</em> is
                            considerable â€” virtually every aspect of the design document
                            can be changed.
                            For example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>keywords can be added, perhaps to match the implementation language;</li>
                            <li>visual enhancements can be changed;</li>
                            <li>specialized indexes can be created;</li>
                            <li>
                                a great deal of useful information about a design can be accumulated
                                and reported by <em>PDL/81</em> by using facilities such as
                                <em>Complexity Analysis</em>, <em>Consistency Checking</em>, and
                                <em>Automatic Requirements Tracking</em>.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            In practice, it is common for a design team to create its own
                            house-style for design documents  by using the
                            <em>Format Design Language</em> component of <em>PDL/81</em>.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Conventional Documents</h2>
                        <p>
                            In addition to software designs, <em>PDL/81</em> is a complete text
                            processor for conventional documents such as manuals, reports,
                            letters, and memos.
                            In fact, all the documents associated with software development can be
                            produced using the same tool.
