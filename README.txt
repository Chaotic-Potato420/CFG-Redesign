THIS WEBSITE IS A REDESIGN PROJECT THEREFORE ALL DESIGN ELEMENTS BELONG TO LILY DEHAVEN.

Inspiration
    For this project, I decided that redesigning an old webpage would be fun! I did some research
    and found that Caine, Farber and Gordon, Inc.'s website needed some contemporary upgrades!
    
Implementation
    I managed to keep a consistant color scheme with the original website plus incorporating the orange 
    and brown from the company's logo. I also used all of their text and images but with a more modern
    design that would match more current websites.

    I also updated the navigation bar, to be more visually appealing. Along with that, I modified the
    Introduction to PDL/81 page to be more userfriendly and eliminated all inconvient breadcrumb navigations!
